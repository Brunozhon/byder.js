# How to contirbuite on Byder.js

## Did you find a bug?

- **Don't open a issue if it is a disscusion-related topic ([genaral](https://github.com/Brunozhon/byder.js/discussions?discussions_q=category%3AGeneral), [ideas](https://github.com/Brunozhon/byder.js/discussions?discussions_q=category%3AIdeas), [Q&A](https://github.com/Brunozhon/byder.js/discussions?discussions_q=category%3AQ%26A), [show and tell](https://github.com/Brunozhon/byder.js/discussions?discussions_q=category%3A%22Show+and+tell%22)).** Instead refer to one of the links I gave you.
- **Ensure that the bug is not reported by searching in [issues](https://github.com/Brunozhon/byder.js/issues).**
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Brunozhon/byder.js/issues/new). Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.
